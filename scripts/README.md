# CMC-SPARQL Pipeline Template

This project demonstrates a simple, reusable pipeline for querying biomedical ontologies (e.g., UniProt) using SPARQL. Designed with CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing & Controls) data use cases in mind, it serves as a starting point for semantic querying, local data export, and downstream integration into visualization or knowledge graph tools.

## üí° Use Case

You can use this template to:
- Pull publicly available data into local CSV format
- Map ontology terms to support Master Data or formulation studies
- Showcase your data stewardship skills (e.g., SPARQL, RDF, FAIR)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Clone the repo and install requirements:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grant-mueller/cmc-sparql-template.git
cd cmc-sparql-template
pip install -r requirements.txt
